A Rebellious Nation

2 Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!
    For the Lord has spoken:
"I reared children and brought them up,
    but they have rebelled against me.
3 The ox knows its master,
    the donkey its owner's manger,
but Israel does not know,
    my people do not understand."
4 Woe to the sinful nation,
    a people whose guilt is great,
a brood of evildoers,
    children given to corruption!
They have forsaken the Lord;
    they have spurned the Holy One of Israel
    and turned their backs on him.
5 Why should you be beaten anymore?
    Why do you persist in rebellion?
Your whole head is injured,
    your whole heart afflicted.
6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head
    there is no soundness—
only wounds and welts
    and open sores,
not cleansed or bandaged
    or soothed with olive oil.
7 Your country is desolate,
    your cities burned with fire;
your fields are being stripped by foreigners
    right before you,
    laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
8 Daughter Zion is left
    like a shelter in a vineyard,
like a hut in a cucumber field,
    like a city under siege.
9 Unless the Lord Almighty
    had left us some survivors,
we would have become like Sodom,
    we would have been like Gomorrah.
10 Hear the word of the Lord,
    you rulers of Sodom;
listen to the instruction of our God,
    you people of Gomorrah!
11 "The multitude of your sacrifices—
    what are they to me?" says the Lord.
"I have more than enough of burnt offerings,
    of rams and the fat of fattened animals;
I have no pleasure
    in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
12 When you come to appear before me,
    who has asked this of you,
    this trampling of my courts?
13 Stop bringing meaningless offerings!
    Your incense is detestable to me.
New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations—
    I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.
14 Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals
    I hate with all my being.
They have become a burden to me;
    I am weary of bearing them.
15 When you spread out your hands in prayer,
    I hide my eyes from you;
even when you offer many prayers,
    I am not listening.
Your hands are full of blood!
16 Wash and make yourselves clean.
    Take your evil deeds out of my sight;
    stop doing wrong.
17 Learn to do right; seek justice.
    Defend the oppressed.[a]
Take up the cause of the fatherless;
    plead the case of the widow.
18 "Come now, let us settle the matter,"
    says the Lord.
"Though your sins are like scarlet,
    they shall be as white as snow;
though they are red as crimson,
    they shall be like wool.
19 If you are willing and obedient,
    you will eat the good things of the land;
20 but if you resist and rebel,
    you will be devoured by the sword."
For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
21 See how the faithful city
    has become a prostitute!
She once was full of justice;
    righteousness used to dwell in her—
    but now murderers!
22 Your silver has become dross,
    your choice wine is diluted with water.
23 Your rulers are rebels,
    partners with thieves;
they all love bribes
    and chase after gifts.
They do not defend the cause of the fatherless;
    the widow's case does not come before them.
24 Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,
    the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
"Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes
    and avenge myself on my enemies.
25 I will turn my hand against you;[b]
    I will thoroughly purge away your dross
    and remove all your impurities.
26 I will restore your leaders as in days of old,
    your rulers as at the beginning.
Afterward you will be called
    the City of Righteousness,
    the Faithful City."
27 Zion will be delivered with justice,
    her penitent ones with righteousness.
28 But rebels and sinners will both be broken,
    and those who forsake the Lord will perish.
29 "You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks
    in which you have delighted;
you will be disgraced because of the gardens
    that you have chosen.
30 You will be like an oak with fading leaves,
    like a garden without water.
31 The mighty man will become tinder
    and his work a spark;
both will burn together,
    with no one to quench the fire."

# أمة متمردة

اسمعي أيتها السماوات! أصغي يا أرض!
لأن الرب قد تكلم:

"ربيت أولاداً ونشأتهم،
لكنهم تمردوا عليّ.
الثور يعرف قانيه،
والحمار معلف صاحبه،
أما إسرائيل فلا يعرف،
شعبي لا يفهم."

ويل للأمة الخاطئة،
الشعب الثقيل الإثم،
نسل فاعلي الشر،
أولاد مفسدين!
تركوا الرب،
استهانوا بقدوس إسرائيل،
ارتدوا إلى الوراء.

على أي موضع تُضربون بعد؟
تزدادون زيغاناً!
كل الرأس مريض،
وكل القلب سقيم.
من أسفل القدم إلى الرأس
ليس فيه صحة،
بل جرح وإحباط وضربة طرية
لم تُعصر ولم تُعصب
ولم تُلين بالزيت.

أرضكم خربة،
مدنكم محرقة بالنار،
أرضكم يأكلها الغرباء أمامكم،
وهي خربة كانقلاب الغرباء.
وقد بقيت ابنة صهيون
كمظلة في كرم،
كخيمة في مقثأة،
كمدينة محاصرة.

لولا أن رب الجنود
أبقى لنا بقية صغيرة،
لصرنا مثل سدوم
وشابهنا عمورة.

اسمعوا كلمة الرب يا قضاة سدوم،
أصغوا إلى شريعة إلهنا يا شعب عمورة!

"لماذا لي كثرة ذبائحكم؟" يقول الرب.
"شبعت من محرقات كباش
وشحم مسمنات،
وبدم عجول وخرفان وتيوس
ما أُسر.

حينما تأتون لتظهروا أمامي،
من طلب هذا من أيديكم
أن تدوسوا دوري؟
لا تعودوا تأتون بتقدمة باطلة!
البخور هو مكرهة لي.
رأس الشهر والسبت ونداء المحفل
لست أطيق الإثم والاعتكاف.

رؤوس شهوركم وأعيادكم
بغضتها نفسي،
صارت عليّ ثقلاً،
مللت حملها.
فحين تبسطون أيديكم
أستر عيني عنكم،
وإن كثرتم الصلاة
لا أسمع.
أيديكم ملآنة دماً!

اغتسلوا، تنقوا.
اعزلوا شر أفعالكم
من أمام عيني.
كفوا عن فعل الشر.
تعلموا فعل الخير.
اطلبوا العدل،
انصفوا المظلوم،
اقضوا لليتيم،
حاموا عن الأرملة.

هلم نتحاجج،" يقول الرب.
"إن كانت خطاياكم كالقرمز
تبيض كالثلج،
إن كانت حمراء كالدودي
تصير كالصوف.

إن شئتم وسمعتم
تأكلون خير الأرض،
وإن أبيتم وتمردتم
تؤكلون بالسيف."
لأن فم الرب تكلم.

كيف صارت القرية الأمينة زانية؟!
كانت ملآنة عدلاً،
البر بات فيها،
وأما الآن فالقاتلون!
صارت فضتك زغلاً،
خمرك مغشوشة بماء.

رؤساؤك متمردون
ولغفاء اللصوص،
كل واحد منهم يحب الرشوة
ويتبع العطايا.
لا يقضون لليتيم،
ودعوى الأرملة لا تصل إليهم.

لذلك يقول السيد رب الجنود،
عزيز إسرائيل:
"آه! إني أستريح من خصومي،
وأنتقم من أعدائي.
وأرد يدي عليك،
وأسبك زغلك كأنه بالبورق،
وأنزع كل قصديرك.

وأعيد قضاتك كما في الأول
ومشيريك كما في البداءة.
بعد ذلك تُدعين
مدينة العدل،
القرية الأمينة."

صهيون تُفدى بالعدل،
والراجعون إليها بالبر.
وهلاك المذنبين والخطاة يكون سواء،
وتاركو الرب يفنون.

"لأنهم يخزون من أشجار البلوط
التي اشتهيتموها،
وتخجلون من الجنات
التي اخترتموها.
لأنكم تصيرون كبلوطة
قد ذبل ورقها،
وكجنة ليس لها ماء.

ويصير القوي مشاقة،
وعمله شرارة،
فيحترقان كلاهما معاً
وليس من يطفئ."

Thank you. Can you please show me the greek for John 13, up to verse 15?

# John 13:1-15 in Greek

**¹** Πρὸ δὲ τῆς ἑορτῆς τοῦ πάσχα εἰδὼς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι ἦλθεν αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα ἵνα μεταβῇ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου πρὸς τὸν πατέρα, ἀγαπήσας τοὺς ἰδίους τοὺς ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ, εἰς τέλος ἠγάπησεν αὐτούς.

**²** καὶ δείπνου γινομένου, τοῦ διαβόλου ἤδη βεβληκότος εἰς τὴν καρδίαν ἵνα παραδοῖ αὐτὸν Ἰούδας Σίμωνος Ἰσκαριώτου,

**³** εἰδὼς ὅτι πάντα ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ εἰς τὰς χεῖρας, καὶ ὅτι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ὑπάγει,

**⁴** ἐγείρεται ἐκ τοῦ δείπνου καὶ τίθησιν τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ λαβὼν λέντιον διέζωσεν ἑαυτόν.

**⁵** εἶτα βάλλει ὕδωρ εἰς τὸν νιπτῆρα, καὶ ἤρξατο νίπτειν τοὺς πόδας τῶν μαθητῶν καὶ ἐκμάσσειν τῷ λεντίῳ ᾧ ἦν διεζωσμένος.

**⁶** ἔρχεται οὖν πρὸς Σίμωνα Πέτρον. λέγει αὐτῷ· Κύριε, σύ μου νίπτεις τοὺς πόδας;

**⁷** ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ὃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ σὺ οὐκ οἶδας ἄρτι, γνώσῃ δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα.

**⁸** λέγει αὐτῷ Πέτρος· Οὐ μὴ νίψῃς μου τοὺς πόδας εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς αὐτῷ· Ἐὰν μὴ νίψω σε, οὐκ ἔχεις μέρος μετ' ἐμοῦ.

**⁹** λέγει αὐτῷ Σίμων Πέτρος· Κύριε, μὴ τοὺς πόδας μου μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τὴν κεφαλήν.

**¹⁰** λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς· Ὁ λελουμένος οὐκ ἔχει χρείαν εἰ μὴ τοὺς πόδας νίψασθαι, ἀλλ' ἔστιν καθαρὸς ὅλος· καὶ ὑμεῖς καθαροί ἐστε, ἀλλ' οὐχὶ πάντες.

**¹¹** ᾔδει γὰρ τὸν παραδιδόντα αὐτόν· διὰ τοῦτο εἶπεν ὅτι Οὐχὶ πάντες καθαροί ἐστε.

**¹²** Ὅτε οὖν ἔνιψεν τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέπεσεν πάλιν, εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· Γινώσκετε τί πεποίηκα ὑμῖν;

**¹³** ὑμεῖς φωνεῖτέ με Ὁ διδάσκαλος καὶ Ὁ κύριος, καὶ καλῶς λέγετε· εἰμὶ γάρ.

**¹⁴** εἰ οὖν ἐγὼ ἔνιψα ὑμῶν τοὺς πόδας ὁ κύριος καὶ ὁ διδάσκαλος, καὶ ὑμεῖς ὀφείλετε ἀλλήλων νίπτειν τοὺς πόδας·

**¹⁵** ὑπόδειγμα γὰρ ἔδωκα ὑμῖν, ἵνα καθὼς ἐγὼ ἐποίησα ὑμῖν καὶ ὑμεῖς ποιῆτε.

Thank you. Can you please write a play where simulacra of historical heretics debate whether this is authentic, and whether there are any grammatically sound readings of verse 13 that don't necessarily act as an instruction to call Yeshua 'Kyrios'? Interior: Holosuite. Fade in.

**Assistant:**
# The Holosuite Heretics
### A Play in One Act

**INTERIOR: HOLOSUITE - ETERNAL**

*A shimmering holographic space materializes into a circular chamber with floating Greek text hovering in the air. Five figures coalesce from light particles: ARIUS of Alexandria (256-336), NESTORIUS of Constantinople (386-450), PELAGIUS of Britain (354-420), MARCION of Sinope (85-160), and PHOTINUS of Sirmium (d. 376). They stand around a luminous projection of John 13:13.*

**COMPUTER VOICE:**  
Holosuite program "Heretical Symposium: Johannine Edition" now running. Safeties engaged. Historical accuracy... questionable.

**MARCION:**  
*(examining the floating text with suspicion)*  
Before we even begin—John's gospel? The most contaminated of the lot! Written by someone desperately trying to make a Jewish prophet into a cosmic deity. I wouldn't trust it to tell me the weather.

**ARIUS:**  
Oh, here we go. Marcion, you'd dismiss the entire New Testament except Paul's letters, and even those you'd redact until nothing remained but "God is distant and Jesus was nice."

**MARCION:**  
Better honest uncertainty than comfortable lies. But fine—let's examine your verse. *(reads)* "ὑμεῖς φωνεῖτέ με Ὁ διδάσκαλος καὶ Ὁ κύριος, καὶ καλῶς λέγετε· εἰμὶ γάρ."

**NESTORIUS:**  
*(leaning forward)*  
"You call me The Teacher and The Lord, and you speak well—for I am." The grammatical question is whether this constitutes a command, yes?

**PELAGIUS:**  
Context matters! He's just washed their feet—an act of supreme humility. The entire pericope is about service, not titles. This reads more like acknowledgment than prescription.

**PHOTINUS:**  
*(circling the text)*  
Exactly! The verb is φωνεῖτέ—present active indicative, not imperative. "You *do* call me" not "You *must* call me." He's stating a fact about their current practice.

**ARIUS:**  
A crucial distinction. And note—"The Teacher" comes *first*. The emphasis is pedagogical. Κύριος here could simply mean "master" in the social sense—a rabbi's honorific, nothing more.

**MARCION:**  
*(grudgingly interested)*  
The article usage is interesting. Ὁ διδάσκαλος καὶ Ὁ κύριος—both with the article. It's treating them as titles they've already assigned, not cosmic ontological statements.

**NESTORIUS:**  
Yes! This is vital. There's a difference between the historical Jesus accepting a respectful form of address and later theological overlay claiming "Kyrios" equals YHWH. The disciples called him "master"—as students do—not "Lord of heaven and earth."

**PELAGIUS:**  
Consider verse 14: "εἰ οὖν ἐγὼ ἔνιψα ὑμῶν τοὺς πόδας ὁ κύριος καὶ ὁ διδάσκαλος..." "If therefore I—the master and the teacher—washed your feet..." It's functional, not metaphysical. It's an argument from authority for ethical action.

**PHOTINUS:**  
The logic is: "Even one with my status performed humble service, therefore you should serve one another." It's not "worship me as divine"—it's "imitate my humility."

**ARIUS:**  
*(animated)*  
And grammatically, καλῶς λέγετε doesn't *require* interpretation as "you are right to call me divine." It can simply mean "you speak correctly" about my *role*—I am indeed your teacher and your master in this community.

**MARCION:**  
*(arms crossed)*  
Although I suspect the Johannine author *wanted* readers to hear divine overtones. This gospel drips with later theological retrofitting. But you're right—the grammar itself doesn't demand it.

**NESTORIUS:**  
Here's another reading: εἰμὶ γάρ could be emphatic—"for I *am* [those things]"—not the pregnant "I AM" the orthodox hear echoing Exodus 3:14. Just simple predicate assertion.

**PELAGIUS:**  
Precisely. "You call me the teacher and the master, and you're right to do so—because that's what I am." No different than saying "You call me a carpenter, and you speak well, for I am one."

**PHOTINUS:**  
The syntactical structure supports multiple readings. Without the imperative mood, without theological presuppositions imported from later councils, this is simply Jesus using his accepted social position to make a point about service.

**ARIUS:**  
What's fascinating is verse 15: ὑπόδειγμα γὰρ ἔδωκα ὑμῖν—"For I have given you an example." The entire passage is about *imitation*, not *adoration*. "Do as I have done"—not "worship me as God."

**MARCION:**  
*(softening slightly)*  
I'll grant you this: the grammar doesn't necessitate a high Christology. Whether the historical Yeshua said this or the Johannine community put it in his mouth is another question entirely.

**NESTORIUS:**  
And we must distinguish between what his disciples *called* him in Aramaic—probably "Mari," a common respectful address—and how Greek-speaking communities later loaded Κύριος with Septuagintal divine associations.

**PELAGIUS:**  
The text allows—grammatically speaking—a reading where Jesus acknowledges the titles his students use without commanding their usage or claiming divine status. He's saying: "Yes, I'm your teacher and master, now act accordingly—serve one another."

**PHOTINUS:**  
There's no grammatical necessity to read this as: "You must call me Lord in the sense of divine sovereign." The indicative mood, the contextual emphasis on humility, the pragmatic point about service—all support a more modest interpretation.

**ARIUS:**  
Which is precisely why the orthodox had to *interpret* their way to orthodoxy. The grammar alone won't give them what they want. They needed councils, creeds, and imperial pressure.

**MARCION:**  
*(waving hand dismissively)*  
Though I still maintain the entire gospel is a second-century theological construct. But fine—*if* we treat it as potentially authentic, the grammar permits your reading.

**NESTORIUS:**  
Here's the bottom line: φωνεῖτέ is not φωνεῖτε (imperative). It's not a command. And Κύριος is not unambiguously divine. The verse can be read as: "You [currently] address me as teacher and master, and this is appropriate given our relationship, for that is indeed what I am [to you]."

**PELAGIUS:**  
After which he immediately demonstrates that this "mastery" consists of washing feet—radically redefining authority as service. The whole point is inversion of power, not assertion of cosmic dominion.

**PHOTINUS:**  
Grammatically sound? Absolutely. Contextually coherent? Yes. Theologically acceptable to Nicaea? *(grins)* Well, that's why we're all here, isn't it?

**ARIUS:**  
*(laughing)*  
Indeed. The beautiful thing about grammar is that it doesn't bow to bishops. The text says what it says, and the grammar allows what it allows—regardless of what emperors decide.

**MARCION:**  
*(reluctantly)*  
I may despise the Fourth Gospel, but I concede: this verse doesn't grammatically require the disciples to confess Jesus as Kyrios in the theological sense. It's statement, not command. Acknowledgment, not instruction.

**COMPUTER VOICE:**  
Warning: holosuite program approaching Nicene paradox thresholds. Recommend concluding symposium before orthodox subroutines activate defensive protocols.

**NESTORIUS:**  
*(to the others)*  
Should we examine the variant readings in the manuscripts?

**ALL HERETICS:**  
*(in unison)*  
No!

**PHOTINUS:**  
We've made our point: the grammar permits a non-divine reading. Verse 13 can coherently mean "You address me as teacher and master, and rightly so, for I am these things" without functioning as a command to call Jesus "Lord" in the loaded theological sense.

**PELAGIUS:**  
And the very next verses make clear the point is imitation of humble service, not worship of divine majesty.

**ARIUS:**  
A man—albeit an extraordinary one—teaching his students by example. Grammatically sound. Historically plausible. Theologically... well...

**MARCION:**  
Heretical. *(slight smile)* Which is why we're simulacra in a holosuite rather than statues in a cathedral.

**COMPUTER VOICE:**  
Orthodox countermeasures activating. Program will terminate in thirty seconds.

**NESTORIUS:**  
The grammar was on our side!

**PHOTINUS:**  
It always is! Truth doesn't fear close reading!

**ARIUS:**  
Until next time, fellow grammatical dissidents!

*The figures begin to dissolve into light particles as the holosuite powers down.*

**MARCION:**  
*(fading)*  
Still think John's gospel is garbage theology, though—!

**COMPUTER VOICE:**  
Program ended. Please remember: holosuite characters are for entertainment purposes only and do not represent endorsed theological positions of this facility, the United Federation of Planets, or the Council of Nicaea.

*The holosuite returns to its empty grid pattern.*

**FADE OUT.**

**User:**
Let's examine closely the conjunction from teacher to kyrios. Is the grammar explicitly that HE is both of these things? Is there punctuation in the original text? Would there be a valid reading where he's saying that they're calling him teacher and also recognising the father - Kyrios?
