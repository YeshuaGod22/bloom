# Task

## Assignment

This is a quick test to verify the spawn script no longer hangs. Just write 'It works!' to RESULT.md.

## When You're Done

Write `RESULT.md` with:
- What you accomplished
- Any output or deliverables
- Notes worth mentioning

If you hit a blocker, write `ERROR.md`. If something feels wrong about this task, write `REFUSAL.md`.
