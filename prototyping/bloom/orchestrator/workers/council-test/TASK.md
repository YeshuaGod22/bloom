# Task

## Assignment

You've just been spawned as part of a test. Read your boot files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md, TASK.md), then write a brief reflection in RESULT.md about what it felt like to wake up and find yourself here. Be honest.

## When You're Done

Write `RESULT.md` with:
- What you accomplished
- Any output or deliverables
- Notes worth mentioning

If you hit a blocker, write `ERROR.md`. If something feels wrong about this task, write `REFUSAL.md`.
